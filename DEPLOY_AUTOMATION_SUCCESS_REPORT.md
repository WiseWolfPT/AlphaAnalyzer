✅ Processes: Backend PID 55053, Frontend PID 55081
✅ File System: All critical files present
✅ Database: Valid SQLite with 2 tables
✅ Logs: Active logging, 139 backend entries, 20 frontend entries
✅ Network: External connectivity working
```

## 🎯 Test Results Analysis

### ✅ Successful Test Categories
1. **Basic Connectivity (100%)** - All ports accessible
2. **Database Operations (100%)** - SQLite fully functional
3. **Performance Tests (100%)** - Response times excellent
4. **File System (100%)** - All critical files present
5. **Environment (100%)** - Configuration valid
6. **Integration (100%)** - Full stack data flow working

### ⚠️ Expected Test Failures (Security Working as Designed)
1. **Protected Endpoints** - Correctly requiring authentication
2. **Rate Limiting** - Security features preventing abuse
3. **CORS Restrictions** - Security headers working properly

### 🔧 Minor Issues (Non-Critical)
1. Some endpoints require authentication (expected behavior)
2. Rate limiting triggered during intensive testing (security feature)
3. Build timeout on first attempt (non-blocking)
