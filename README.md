  - Location: `./data/alfalyzer.db`
  - Automatic setup with migrations
  - No additional configuration needed

- **Staging/Production**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
  - Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL
  - Requires Supabase account and keys
  - Migrations in `migrations/postgres-migrations/`

### Migration Management

```bash
# SQLite (Development)
npm run migrate          # Run all pending migrations
npm run migrate:status   # Check migration status
npm run migrate:rollback # Rollback last migration

# Supabase (Production)
# Use Supabase dashboard or CLI to run migrations from migrations/postgres-migrations/
```

**Note**: Keep both SQLite and PostgreSQL migrations synchronized when making schema changes.

npm install
npm run dev
```
