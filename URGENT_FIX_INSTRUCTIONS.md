# URGENT: Fix Advanced Charts Routing Issue

The routing issue showing "Did you forget to add the page to the router?" can be fixed by deploying the latest changes.

## Quick Fix (Double-click method):

1. **Double-click** the file: `FIX_ROUTING_DEPLOY.command`
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to rebuild
3. Test: https://stock-analysis-app-sigma.vercel.app/stock/AAPL/charts

## Manual Fix (Terminal method):

If double-click doesn't work, open Terminal and run:

```bash
cd "/Users/antoniofrancisco/Documents/teste 1"
git add .
git commit -m "fix: ensure AdvancedCharts routing works properly"
git push origin main
```

## What should happen:

- ✅ `/stock/AAPL` shows original charts with "View Advanced Charts" button
- ✅ `/stock/AAPL/charts` shows 14 advanced charts in 4x4 grid
- ✅ Navigation works between both pages

## If still not working:

1. Check Vercel deployment logs at vercel.com
2. Ensure GitHub repository WiseWolfPT/AlphaAnalyzer has latest changes
3. Verify automatic deployment is enabled in Vercel settings

The issue is likely that the routing configuration wasn't properly deployed to production, even though the code exists locally.
