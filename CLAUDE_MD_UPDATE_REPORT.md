# CLAUDE.md Update Report

## Executive Summary

I've updated CLAUDE.md to incorporate critical security improvements and missing implementation details from IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md. The document now provides better guidance for secure development and aligns with the actual project architecture.

## Key Updates Made

### 1. **Critical Security Enhancements**
- **Environment Variable Security Warning**: Added prominent warning about VITE_ prefix exposing variables to client-side
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Emphasized RLS requirements for all Supabase tables
- **API Key Protection**: Clear guidance on backend-only API calls

### 2. **Technology Stack Corrections**
- Database: SQLite → **Supabase** (not PostgreSQL)
- Routing: Added warning to use **Wouter** (NOT React Router)
- State Management: Added React Query + Context API
- Auth: Migrating to **Supabase Auth** from JWT + bcrypt

### 3. **Database Schema Additions**
- Complete Supabase schema with all required tables
- RLS policies for data isolation
- Subscriptions table for Stripe integration
- Proper indexes for performance

### 4. **API Integration Strategy**
- Detailed usage of 4 configured APIs (Twelve Data, FMP, Finnhub, Alpha Vantage)
- Correct cache durations from API_INTEGRATION.md
- API quota management and monitoring
- Backup API options (Polygon, Yahoo Finance, MarketStack)

### 5. **Development Workflow**
- Daily workflow commands
- API integration pattern (Frontend → Backend → External APIs)
- Testing strategy with Vitest configuration
- Before-feature checklist

### 6. **Monitoring & Observability**
- API usage tracking implementation
- Real-time data strategy with WebSocket + Supabase Realtime
- Performance monitoring setup
- CI/CD pipeline details

### 7. **Testing Requirements**
- Added unit, integration, E2E, performance, and security tests
- Vitest configuration example
- Critical test areas identified

### 8. **Common Pitfalls Section**
- Clear "DON'T DO THIS" warnings
- "ALWAYS DO THIS" best practices
- Emphasis on mobile-first and accessibility

## Critical Differences Identified

### 1. **Database Platform**
- CLAUDE.md said: PostgreSQL
- Reality: **Supabase** (includes auth, realtime, storage)

### 2. **Routing Library**
- Not mentioned in original CLAUDE.md
- Reality: **Wouter** (critical - many developers assume React Router)

### 3. **Environment Variables**
- Original: Basic mention
- Updated: **Critical security warning** about VITE_ prefix exposure

### 4. **API Configuration**
- Original: Listed APIs without details
- Updated: **Specific quotas and usage strategy** for each API

### 5. **Testing Strategy**
- Original: Basic requirements
- Updated: **Comprehensive testing approach** with Vitest

## Recommendations for Future Updates

1. **Keep API Quotas Updated**: As you upgrade API tiers, update the quotas in CLAUDE.md
2. **Document New Patterns**: When establishing new patterns, add them to CLAUDE.md
3. **Security First**: Always emphasize security considerations prominently
4. **Version Control**: Consider versioning CLAUDE.md with dates for major updates

## Security Checklist for Developers

- [ ] Never use VITE_ prefix for sensitive API keys
- [ ] Always enable RLS on new Supabase tables
- [ ] API calls must go through backend (not direct from frontend)
- [ ] Test RLS policies to ensure data isolation
- [ ] Use Supabase Auth (don't create custom auth)
- [ ] Monitor API quota usage regularly
- [ ] Cache API responses according to specified durations

## Summary

CLAUDE.md is now aligned with IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md and provides comprehensive, security-focused guidance for implementing Alfalyzer. The document emphasizes critical security considerations, correct technology choices, and practical implementation patterns that will help developers avoid common pitfalls.
