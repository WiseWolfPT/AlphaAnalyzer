# fix: health-check returns 200 + CI test

## 🐛 Problem
The `/health` endpoint was returning HTTP 426 "Upgrade Required" instead of 200 OK, causing monitoring tools to report the service as unhealthy.

## ✅ Solution
Moved the health endpoint definition to the beginning of the Express app setup, before any middleware that could interfere with the request (especially WebSocket middleware).

## 📝 Changes
- ✅ Moved `/health` route before all middleware in `server/index.ts`
- ✅ Added `test-health-endpoint.cjs` to verify both endpoints return 200
- ✅ Added `npm run test:health` script for easy testing
- ✅ Removed duplicate health endpoint definition
- ✅ Added GitHub Actions CI workflow with health-check test

## 🧪 Testing
```bash
# Run the health check test
npm run test:health

# Manual test
curl -I http://localhost:3001/health
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## ✔️ Verification
Both endpoints now return proper 200 OK status:
- `/health` - Basic health check
- `/api/health` - API health with more details

## 📋 CI/CD Workflow
Add this workflow file as `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  quality:
    name: Code Quality & Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '20'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci

    - name: Health-check endpoint test
      run: npm run test:health
    
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build

  security:
    name: Security Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Run security audit
      run: npm audit --audit-level=high || true
```

Closes Phase 1 health check requirement.
