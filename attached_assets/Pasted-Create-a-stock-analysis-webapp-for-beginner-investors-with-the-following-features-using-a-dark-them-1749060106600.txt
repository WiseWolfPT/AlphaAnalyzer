Side Panel: On click, show:

Header: Logo, name, live price.

Tabs: 'Earnings (Khoo)' (default), 'Free Cash Flow' (placeholder).

Form: Editable inputs for EPS (TTM), EPS Growth Rate, Horizon (10 years), PE Multiple (cap 35), Required Return (15%), Margin of Safety (25%, slider 0-50%).

Results (400ms debounce): Future EPS, Future Price, Present Value, Intrinsic Value, Delta %, badge.

Gauge: Speedometer for delta % (same colors).

Buttons: 'Save Assumptions' (localStorage), 'Export PDF'.

Use Advanced Drawer: Options for presets (Conservative, Base, Aggressive), manual CAGR by intervals (e.g., years 1-5, 6-10), discount rate (10%-20%), save presets in localStorage.

Calculation Logic:

Inputs: EPS (fetch), growth rate (capped 20%, default 10%), horizon (10 years), PE (min{current PE, 2×growth, 35}), required return (15%), margin of safety (25%).

Future EPS = EPS * (1 + growth rate)^years.

Future Price = Future EPS * PE.

Present Value = Future Price / (1 + required return)^years.

Intrinsic Value = Present Value * (1 - margin of safety).

Delta % = (Intrinsic Value / Current Price - 1) * 100.

Classification: Undervalued (delta ≤ -3%), Neutral (-3% < delta < 3%), Overvalued (delta ≥ 3%).

General Design:

Dark theme: Card background (#1b2432), hover (#243047).

Accessibility: ARIA labels, focus states, 4px border on cards for colorblind users (same as badge color).

Keyboard Shortcuts: '/' to focus search, 'Esc' to close panels.

Performance: Cache API data for 30 minutes (localStorage), lazy-load cards.

APIs:

Use APIs (free tiers) for stock data (price, EPS, earnings).

Fetch logos from Clearbit (free API).

For specific KPIs (e.g., MSFT: 365 Consumer Subscribers), use also Free APIs.

Deployment:

Deploy to a subdomain (e.g., stock-analysis.emergent.sh).

Ensure the app is live and accessible.

Build this webapp with a clean, user-friendly UI for beginners. Optimize for performance and ensure all features are functional within the free tier constraints of the APIs."

for the intrinsic value section I want to display some cards with the most searched or most traded companies or with the most market cap or most popular and in those card we must already see if the stock is undervalued, neutral ou overvalued vs it's current price. please use the adam khoo method on the backend to auto calculate this intrinsic values for this stocks. also add an advance tool tip where more advanced users could edit some data to found their intrinsic value.

I will send you right now some printscreens from qualtrim platform that's the inspirational plataform. I will also send you screen shots from qualtrim cache .

If you want me to provide more pictures from qualtrim just say it
