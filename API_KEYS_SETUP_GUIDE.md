```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Edit the `.env` file with your API keys:

```bash
# Alpha Vantage API
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY="your_actual_alpha_vantage_key_here"
VITE_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY="your_actual_alpha_vantage_key_here"

# Finnhub API
FINNHUB_API_KEY="your_actual_finnhub_key_here"
VITE_FINNHUB_API_KEY="your_actual_finnhub_key_here"

# Twelve Data API
TWELVE_DATA_API_KEY="your_actual_twelve_data_key_here"
VITE_TWELVE_DATA_API_KEY="your_actual_twelve_data_key_here"

# Financial Modeling Prep API

VITE_FMP_API_KEY="your_actual_fmp_key_here"
```

**Important Notes:**
- Both `API_KEY` and `VITE_API_KEY` versions are needed
- `VITE_` prefixed variables are used by the frontend (Vite build system)
- Non-prefixed variables are used by the backend server
- Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control

### 3. Restart your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## API Usage Strategy

To maximize your free tier usage:

### Daily Allocation Recommendations:
- **Alpha Vantage (25/day):** Use for fundamental data only, cache aggressively
- **Finnhub (60/minute):** Primary source for real-time quotes and price updates
- **Twelve Data (800/day):** Use for historical data and time series analysis
- **FMP (250/day):** Use for detailed financial statements and earnings data

### Optimization Tips:
1. **Enable Caching:** The app includes intelligent caching to minimize API calls
2. **Batch Requests:** When possible, request multiple symbols in single API calls
3. **Monitor Usage:** Check the debug dashboard to track your API usage
4. **Prioritize Symbols:** Focus on stocks you're actively monitoring

## Testing Your Setup

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the stock search page
3. Search for a popular stock symbol (e.g., "AAPL")
4. Verify that data loads from all sources
5. Check the browser console for any API errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"API key invalid" errors:**
- Double-check that you copied the API key correctly
- Ensure no extra spaces or characters
- Verify the API key is active in the provider's dashboard

**"Rate limit exceeded" errors:**
- You've hit the daily/minute limit for that API
- Wait for the limit to reset or upgrade to a paid plan
- Check the debug dashboard for usage statistics

**"No data available" errors:**
- The stock symbol might not be available in the free tier
- Try a different, more popular stock symbol
- Some APIs have limited coverage on free tiers

### Getting Help:

1. Check the provider's documentation and status pages
2. Contact API provider support for account-specific issues
3. Review the application logs in the browser console
4. Use the built-in cache dashboard to monitor API usage

## Cost Considerations

All these APIs offer generous free tiers suitable for personal use and development. If you need more data or higher limits:

- **Alpha Vantage:** Paid plans start at $49.99/month
- **Finnhub:** Paid plans start at $1,000/month
- **Twelve Data:** Paid plans start at $29/month
- **FMP:** Paid plans start at $14/month

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive data
3. **Rotate keys regularly** if they become compromised
4. **Monitor usage** to detect unauthorized access
5. **Use HTTPS only** for all API communications
